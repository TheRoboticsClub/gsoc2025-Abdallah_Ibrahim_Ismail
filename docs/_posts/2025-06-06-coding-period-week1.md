The focus of this week was to establish a foundation for coding standards and practices within the JdeRobot community. The goal is to ensure that all code contributions are consistent, maintainable, and adhere to best practices.


### Work Done This Week
- [X] Define an initial **Coding Style Guide** through a survey -> [Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/JdeRobot/discussions/317)
- [X] Setup an initial linting CI workflow for Python using Black
- [X] Research other best practices (Branch Protection, pre-commit Hooks, ...)

#### Reflections
- My main focus was:
  - Make sure the style guide is easy to follow and implement
  - Ensure tooling support (i.e. there are mature linters and formatters available to enforce the style)
  - The balance between opinionated style and flexibility for custom configuration
