The focus of this week is to finalize the CI workflows for the RoboticsInfrastructure project.

Also, I reviewed the structure of the RoboticsAcademy project, and planned setting up both the frontend and backend tests.

### Work Done
- [X] Robotics Infrastructure: Add CI workflow for Gazebo Harmonic tests
- [X] Review Django testing documentation
- [X] Robotics Academy: Plan frontend tests
- [X] Robotics Academy: Plan backend tests

### Notes
- Use best practices to handle headless testing in CI.
