The primary goal of this project is to establish an automated testing framework for the Robotics Academy (RA), Robotics Infrastructure (RI), and Robotics Application Manager (RAM) repositories.

This framework will include a suite of unit and integration tests to verify functional correctness and ensure that the software remains maintainable and robust. 
 
Additionally, the project will focus on creating continuous integration (CI) pipelines, ensuring early detection of issues, and fostering a culture of quality and accountability across the projects.
